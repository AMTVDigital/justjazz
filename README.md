# OpenProducer

OpenProducer is a framework for building websites for musicians, radio stations, and others in the music industry. 

## Built on top of Newspack and WordPress
OpenProducer is built on top of [Newspack](https://newspack.blog/), an advanced open-source publishing and revenue-generating platform for news organizations. Rather than starting from scratch, we are mixing in additional functionality for radio stations, podcasters, and other types of producers in music and media.

## Will be usable soon
This project is in early stages but we'll be adding instructions on how to install, test, and contribute very soon.

Thanks!!!
